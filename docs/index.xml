      <description>There are examples of systems with incredible organizational complexity in nature. Birds in flocks, fishes in schools, ants in swarms all seem to just chug away, each doing their little part, and yet together they produce these incredibly complex systems we marvel about.
They scale really well too. There are some ant super-colonies that have billions of members, like for example the super-colony in Southern Europe, which stretches for 6000km. And some are extremely sophisticated.</description>

      <description>If I sign myself Jean-Paul Sartre it is not the same thing as if I sign myself Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prizewinner.
  When I joined the company I currently work at I was a privacy noob. Little did I know that Privacy wars will be the next big thing in the Big Tech.
There is a prevailing view that any kind of Data is a kind of commodity.</description>

      <description>How do you know what a cat is?
It is certainly something furry, four-legged with a head and tail. But so is a dog. And a mouse. It certainly is something that meows - but some cats do not meow, yet we still agree they are cats. We can even (hopefully) agree that in the picture above there are three cats, even though we see nine legs, do not hear any meows, and see completely different color patterns on each.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Oleksandr Paraska. Currently I work at eyeo, exploring different ways you can apply progress in machine learning to ad blocking. My wife, my son and I currently live in Bonn, Germany.</description>

      <title>ML meetup</title>

      <description>eyeo is proud to host a Cologne AI and Machine Learning meetup. This meetup is focused on AI explainability and of course with our exploration of the use of machine learning for ad blocking we are very interested in the topic as well.
Explainabile AI (XAI) is an old problem of the field, but with recent advances mostly in Deep Learning it became much more prominent. After all people do want to know why a medical AI made this diagnosis as opposed to another one, or why did the autonomous vehicle take that specific action.</description>

      <description>Recently my employer Adblock Plus was having an annual Summer Team Week. Being a mostly distributed company it is a great opportunity to socialize and meet people you work with, but never get to see in real life.
As it often happens in these cases after some amount of social activities I overheard someone jokingly suggesting that us being a company which has this goal of “putting you in charge of a fair and profitable Web”, we can just block the face of Donald Trump using some machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Towards more intelligent ad blocking on the web</title>

      <description>Ad blockers of today rely heavily on a community of filter authors, who are continuously adding, changing and removing the filters which define what is blocked or what is considered an ad. It is quite a laborious task, often requiring constantly visiting the same websites again and again, just to make sure the stuff that is supposed to be blocked gets blocked, and stuff that should not — doesn’t.
To alleviate some of the pain points of this process it would be useful to automate some routine parts, while keeping human authors doing what they do best — judging what constitutes an ad.</description>

      <description>Optimize for happiness  Note: this is a copy of an original post from my Blogspot. It is a very old post, and does not necessary reflect my position now. I just keep it here for future references.
 Recently I came across the idea of happiness optimization. It basicly says something like - do what you like to do - that way the product will be better, and you wil be happier.</description>
