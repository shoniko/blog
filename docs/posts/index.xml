			<description>There are examples of systems with incredible organizational complexity in nature. Birds in flocks, fishes in schools, ants in swarms all seem to just chug away, each doing their little part, and yet together they produce these incredibly complex systems we marvel about.
They scale really well too. There are some ant super-colonies that have billions of members, like for example the super-colony in Southern Europe, which stretches for 6000km.¬†And some are extremely sophisticated.</description>

<p>There are examples of systems with incredible organizational complexity in nature. Birds in flocks, fishes in schools, ants in swarms all seem to just chug away, each doing their little part, and yet together they produce these incredibly complex systems we marvel about.</p>
<p>They scale really well too. There are some ant super-colonies that have billions of members, like for example the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8127000/8127519.stm">super-colony in Southern Europe, which stretches for 6000km</a>.¬†</p>
<p>And some are extremely sophisticated. Like leaf-cutter ants, who are¬†<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH3KYBMpxOU">practicing agriculture</a> and antibiotics for more than 50 million years now, long before humans figured it out. The silly little things purposefully grow fungus! Not an easy task, as you may know if you ever tried to get your own <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/03/9606502/sourdough-bread-with-starter-baking-trend">sourdough starter</a>.</p>
<p>There are some beautiful leadership lessons from insect societies. Let's call it swarm intelligence.</p>
<p>For example, when a swarm of bees sets out to move somewhere only roughly <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/20/3287">5% of bees know where they are actually going</a>. The 5% who do know are the highly energetic &ldquo;streaker bees&rdquo; who constantly fly through the swarm with one goal - to just fly faster in the desired direction than anyone else in other directions.</p>
<p>Swarm intelligence is curious because it is more than just a wisdom of the smartest individuals. It produces behaviors no single individual is capable of. It is hard to get started, but is very resilient once it is has started.</p>

<h2 id="organizations">Organizations</h2>
<p>One peculiar feature of self-organizations is that they have no &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are lots of cases of human self-organization. The whole concept of &ldquo;free markets&rdquo; is probably the biggest global experiment in that regard. But also perhaps an open source movement and bitcoin are all good examples cases of leader-less self-organizations.</p>
<p>As in animals, human self-organization produces incredibly powerful results. A human swarm intelligence can <a href="https://unanimous.ai/ai-wins-oscars/">predict the winners of Oscars, Kentucky Derby and Trump's 100 days approval rating</a>. It can also give us Linux, defeat Communism, establish a new digital world currency and much more.</p>
<p>But, as an example of &ldquo;free markets&rdquo; shows - such systems need to be tended to very carefully. They are working well only when they are in an equilibrium, and whoever is looking after them has to be very attuned to all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organized_criticality_control">criticalities</a>. Swarms need managers.</p>
<p>Technology enables an ever increasing connectedness of human organizations. It lends us an opportunity to rely on swarm intelligence way more than before. But it also means that we need to be more mindful than before about the benefits and limits of such structures.</p>
<p>Management and leadership in a connected world is a bit like a political choice. How much should be left for self-organization? How much do you believe in the Free Market?</p>
<p>Obviously no right or wrong answers there. But there is one thing that is clear.</p>
<p>Everyone would benefit from being a bit more like a streaker bee. They are kind of cool.</p>
<p>Be a bee! üêù</p>

			<description>How do you know what a cat is?
It is certainly something furry, four-legged with a head and tail. But so is a dog. And a mouse. It certainly is something that meows - but some cats do not meow, yet we still agree they are cats. We can even (hopefully) agree that in the picture above there are three cats, even though we see nine legs, do not hear any meows, and see completely different color patterns on each.</description>

<p>How do you know what a cat is?</p>
<p>It is certainly something furry, four-legged with a head and tail. But so is a dog. And a mouse. It certainly is something that meows - but some cats do not meow, yet we still agree they are cats. We can even (hopefully) agree that in the picture above there are three cats, even though we see nine legs, do not hear any meows, and see completely different color patterns on each.</p>
<p>The point is this: it is surprisingly difficult to define most of every day things we take for granted. Back in 2017, a couple of researchers wrote a paper where they tried to define what a physical container is. That paper is 60 pages long. One can probably also write a definition of a cat in a similar fashion, but it would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hilarious</li>
<li>Very labor intensive</li>
<li>Not necessarily transferrable to definitions of other entities - like &ldquo;chair&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-how-does-this-relate-to-content-filtering-and-what-i-want-to-talk-about-today">So how does this relate to content filtering and what I want to talk about today?</h3>
<p>Defining a cat using a set of rules would be considered a &ldquo;symbolic&rdquo; approach to AI. Symbolic AI is a method most prominently used in the 90s, and it does have a lot of applications where it works fine.</p>
<p>However, for reasons described above, it does not really scale to a lot of real world concepts. Thus connectionism (in a form of Deep Learning) came along. In the connectionist world, there is no explicitly defined set of rules, rather there's just a dataset of training examples and an optimization objective which an algorithm should accomplish on its own.</p>
<p>A connectionist's cat is learned, not hard coded.</p>

<h2 id="implications-for-the-web">Implications for the Web</h2>
<p>Most of the content filtering on the Web today is done using a set of rules (a.k.a filter lists). Even though those rules are rather simplistic for AI standards, it is reasonable to say that this is a symbolic AI. Knowledge is placed there, not learned.</p>
<p>Symbolic AI systems are also sometimes called &ldquo;expert systems&rdquo;, and I find it interesting to think about an ad blocker as an expert system.</p>
<p>As the Web evolves, ad blocking filters (rules) become more and more sophisticated and complex. They already went from simplistic rules like <em>&ldquo;hide elements that have feature X&rdquo;</em> to constructs like <em>&ldquo;hide elements which have property X, are nested within element Y with feature T and have a sibling Z with feature R&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>While this does still work in most cases, further evolution could be hard to maintain. On top of that, thanks to <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a> and <a href="https://acceptableads.com/">Acceptable Ads</a>, recent developments of the Web push the advertising to be more subtle and merge with content even more.</p>
<p>Advertising can look like &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; items:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/outbrain.png"
         alt="Recommended posts by Outbrain"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Recommended posts by Outbrain</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>or like content itself:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/native_ad.png"
         alt="Native advertising by Mercedes-Benz in Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/mercedes/the-rise-of-the-superhuman/"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Native advertising by Mercedes-Benz in Washington Post: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/mercedes/the-rise-of-the-superhuman/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/mercedes/the-rise-of-the-superhuman/</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It can also be in the form of Server Side Ad Insertion in media streams, sponsored messages in podcasts and YouTube, a paragraph in an otherwise interesting article, a logo on an image and more.</p>
<p>Some of these are already not addressable by content blockers - there is no language to write rules for those cases.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="developing-software-20">Developing software 2.0</h2>
<p>So while an ad blocker as an expert system works, it explicitly tries to limit the scope of what it is. This is because, to list a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ad blocker only tries to block advertising, and nothing else</li>
<li>it blocks the same things for everyone - different users, subscribed to same filter lists (expert system) would see the same things blocked</li>
<li>it does not actually have a concept of an &ldquo;ad&rdquo; internally  - it only works on proxy concepts. If a website or ad delivery method changes, it stops working until someone fixes it</li>
<li>it constantly needs to increase the rule complexity. A constant game of cat and mouse with publishers who keep circumventing ad blockers causes this</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these limitations make perfect sense, and even with them it is extremely challenging to implement an ad blocker properly.</p>
<p>But let's just wonder for a second what would happen if we removed these restrictions? Yes, this could probably enable identifying advertising using much more subtle cues, but one thing for sure is that it will certainly increase the complexity of the whole ad blocking system. And that is assuming if it would be feasible at all.</p>
<p><strong>Unless we go away with a concept of ad blocker as a symbolic (expert) system and consider an ad blocker as a connectionist system.</strong></p>
<p>If we consider dropping explicit rules and rely on compiling datasets into models we would effectively arrive at a Software 2.0 implementation of a content filtering paradigm. Instead of a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; limited Software 1.0 system, we could have a much broader, and flexible, implementation in <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>Software 2.0 systems can implement much more complex systems, if only for a fact that in a way it is not humans who write them. A Software 2.0 system can &ldquo;understand&rdquo; what a cat is. Or what the article is about. Or if a specific element on a page was likely paid for (ie advertising).</p>
<p>Paul Graham, captured a similar sentiment in this old tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need a new AdBlock that (a) is less visible to sites and (b) doesn&#39;t rely on fixed strings.</p>&mdash; Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/817300296204427264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there?</h2>
<p><em><strong>Perhaps counter intuitively, real obstacles on a path to a more Software 2.0 content filtering is not a lack of research in machine learning and AI, or some exuberant costs for trainings needed. It is existing Software 1.0.</strong></em></p>
<p>All of the Web is built around ideas of expert systems. Browsers expect you to provide a list of CSS <strong>rules</strong> to modify how they display things. With <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declarativeNetRequest">declarativeNetRequest</a> you are also expected to provide a list of <strong>rules</strong> to decide which URLs to block.</p>
<p>As the Web matures, browsers take on more and more power over user's online behavior. Since they were originally designed as &ldquo;User Agents&rdquo;, they try to provide some degree of control to their users, by implementing support for all these rules.</p>
<p>However <strong>would a real User Agent created in 2020 rely on rules to augment the user experience?</strong></p>
<p>More importantly, what are the chances such a User Agent would be successful in serving the User's interests when there are hundreds of models, trained on lots of user data, by big corporations trying to influence the User?</p>
<p>The movement to get the benefits of the AI transformation on the Web has already started, with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">tenslorflow.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxjs">onnx.js</a>, <a href="https://mil-tokyo.github.io/webdnn/docs/">webdnn</a> and other frameworks enabling machine learning models in browsers. <a href="https://mil-tokyo.github.io/webdnn/docs/">W3C Machine Learning community</a> group is also moving into the same direction, by trying to standardize on a fast and efficient way to run machine learning inference on the Web.</p>
<p>However merely enabling machine learning predictions is not enough, and a deeper transformation is likely needed. For example, maybe on top of supporting a list of CSS rules browsers could also support a list of machine learning models for augmenting the DOM? This is a change to the fabric of the Web, and WebKit/Safari has already started experimenting with this broader change with <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/"><strong>Intelligent Tracking Prevention</strong></a>.</p>
<p>But why stop at cookies and not apply the same kind of thinking to other areas of the Web? Perhaps with enough articulation from an ad blocking industry something like Intelligent Content Blocking can be standardized on? Hopefully a user will just need to decide on a provider.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="eating-the-elephant">Eating the elephant</h2>
<p>It certainly is not obvious such a thing would be possible yet, but the only way forward I see is to try &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+do+you+eat+an+elephant">eating an elephant one bite at a time</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://eyeo.com/">eyeo</a> we have already started using machine learning as a complimentary resource for our ad blocking expert system. However, following this path will likely be ineffective without a community-wide effort to change the inner workings of the Web.¬†And that‚Äôs why it is better to start having discussions now.</p>
<p>Where are we going? What is our future? Is it useful to go beyond ads? Are we enabling content bubbles by allowing people to block specific content? How can we ensure adversarial robustness of such systems?</p>
<p>We may not need all the answers, but we need to have a joint understanding of the important questions.</p>
<p>I would like to leave you with perhaps the most important question of them all - do we want to enable users to block all the cats on the Web? Do we want CatBlock?</p>
<p>Let's discuss!</p>

			<description>Optimize for happiness  Note: this is a copy of an original post from my Blogspot. It is a very old post, and does not necessary reflect my position now. I just keep it here for future references.
 Recently I came across the idea of happiness optimization. It basicly says something like - do what you like to do - that way the product will be better, and you wil be happier.</description>

</blockquote>
<p>Recently I came across the idea of happiness optimization. It basicly says something like - do what you like to do - that way the product will be better, and you wil be happier.</p>
<p>I never concidered my self a great programmer. That is true. I never liked programming contests, as I'm not really sure what are those for. I beleive that a good programmer is a happy programmer. And that is it. Which is why I've decided to optimize for happiness.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm too much motivation driven, but I really think that satisfaction from the job is obligatory.</p>
<p>I really think that programmers should have life. If you ever read Douglass Coupland's &ldquo;Microsofters&rdquo; I think you'll know what I mean. By life I mean girlfriend, parties, trips, friends, etc. This is mandatory. Ofcourse there are nightly shifts etc, but programmer is a human beeing, and he/she should be able to have fun. Code shouldn't be the meaning of the life. Life should. I don't see the reason to write a good code by sacrificing even the smallest peace of your own life. Maybe opensource commnity will strongly disagree with me on that :).</p>
<p>I remember some interview with Linus Torwalds, where he was describing his first steps in programming. Oh common - who can think now programming on machine language can be fun? Obviously he can. I remember it was something like: &ldquo;And look, I change this bit - and it moves! wow! cool!&quot;. Didn't we all had a simiar feeling? Don't we all love the possibilities thos machines give us in controlling themselves? Isn't THAT fun? Isn't THAT art or whatever you call it? Isn't THAT why we all are so into it?</p>
<p>One of the reasons I've started programming was to get more into various audio stuff, as I was keen of producing music. And it was really something - to hear those lines of code producing sound. That was my wow. That is my inspiration. I hate working without inspiration and I actually don'r remember if I ever did. I really don't know what was &ldquo;wow&rdquo; for those programmer–≤ who love Database programming - that is like fata morgana to me. Man is that boring?</p>
<p>So this is my current position as to what should the work look like - work should be fun. Otherwise it's not yours and you will do a great favor to yourself and others by turning around and looking for something more suitable for you. I'm pretty sure this will change in future, when I will be a bit older and would like to have a static home and job. Right now that is not for me, so I've decided to quit SoftServe and register as an enterpreneur with a state.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of SoftServe employees for being patient to my weirdness that was bugging them sometimes;).</p>
