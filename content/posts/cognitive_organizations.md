## A Cognitive Organisation

Here's a simple question:  
**If AI adds intelligence to organisations, what kind of intelligence are we actually adding?**

In this context I find it useful to differentiate between intelligence and cognition. Cognition is about how systems think. Intelligence - how well they think. For understanding AI inside organizations I find it more useful to think about cognition than intelligence. Which brings me to what’s often called the *[4E framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4E_cognition)* — the fourth generation of cognitive science. 

My main thesis here is that cognition isn’t just something that happens inside the brain but is **Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, and Extended**. Once you start seeing cognition this way, you realise that the intelligence of a team isn’t confined to individual minds — it stretches across laptops, chats, meetings, documents, and now, AI agents.

At **Togal.ai**, where we build AI for the construction industry, I spend most days somewhere between code, coordination, and cognitive reflection. We use **Slack, Google Workspace, AWS, Sentry, GitHub, and ChatGPT Enterprise** — a pretty standard modern stack. But something interesting happens when you start to treat those tools not just as utilities, but as **parts of a shared mind**.

## Applying AI Isn’t Like Installing a Tool

Most tech adoption follows a familiar pattern: evaluate, install, train, optimize.  
AI is different. When you plug an AI model into your workflows, you’re not just adding a tool — you’re **changing cognition**. That means it changes not just what we can do, but how we *think and coordinate*.

That’s why frameworks like 4E matter. They give us language for something executives feel intuitively but rarely articulate: the line between **automation** and **intelligence** is not just about speed or cost. It’s about *where cognition happens* in an organization.

## Embodied: Where the Thinking Happens

At Togal, most thinking already happens inside Slack threads, GitHub comments, or Google Docs.  
So when we use **ChatGPT Enterprise** to summarize threads or generate documentation, that’s an *embodied* intelligence — it lives where we work.  

In other companies, this might look like **Slack AI**, **Microsoft 365 Copilot**, or **Notion AI**, which meet people inside the tools they already inhabit. The trick is not to build yet another portal, but to let the AI live among the humans — the same way cognition lives in the body.

## Embedded: Feeding It Real Context

An AI without context is like a brain without sensory input.  
At Togal, we’re experimenting with OpenAI’s **Company Knowledge** and **Connectors**. They let ChatGPT access company data from approved sources — Slack, Drive, GitHub — but under enterprise control. It’s still early, but it’s the closest I’ve seen to an organization building a *shared working memory*.  

Anthropic’s **Claude for Enterprise** and Microsoft’s **Graph Connectors** are exploring similar territory — different philosophies, same goal: *contextual intelligence* instead of raw horsepower.

## Enacted: Letting the System Learn by Doing

Cognition is not just storage; it’s action.  
We’re learning that AI becomes truly useful only when it starts *doing things*, not just answering questions. Writing a summary, filing a bug, tagging an error in Sentry — these are all micro-actions through which the organisation “thinks.”

In this sense, AI is like a new team member who learns by participation. You don’t want it replacing people; you want it to pick up *patterns of coordination* by being embedded in them.

## Extended: Building a Shared Mind

The more I integrate AI into our daily flow, the more the company starts to feel like a distributed mind.  
ChatGPT Enterprise lets us query knowledge across different tools. GitHub stores collective reasoning about code. Slack becomes the short-term memory. Our documents and dashboards form the long-term one.  

Intelligence emerges not from a single system, but from the *relationships* between them — the digital equivalent of neurons firing across departments.

Other companies might go further — using **Notion AI** for project context or **Anthropic’s Claude** for structured reasoning. The tools differ, but the direction is the same: cognition is being extended beyond humans, across systems.

## Why This Matters

AI is forcing us to confront an uncomfortable truth:  
we can’t manage intelligence as if it were infrastructure.  
It’s not something you install — it’s something you *cultivate*.

At Togal, this is still an experiment. I’m trying to merge three spheres that don’t usually talk: **AI**, **4E cognitive science**, and **management**. My hunch is that the next generation of companies won’t just be data-driven or AI-assisted — they’ll be **cognitively designed**.

In other words:  
To build intelligent organizations, we have to understand what intelligence *is*.
